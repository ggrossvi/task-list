### This is a first draft of my #100 days of code web site.

The index page is a carousel of areas of interest I have worked on for #100 days of code.  



Project 1 recieves a response from an api and puts the response values in a table.  
This was a bit challenging since the photos were all different sizes. I still researching whether I can control the size of the photos through css.

Future updates will include adding more options to the navigation bar, including a login page and a logo. 

Also adding a description of the projects in the carousel.
Resizing the pictures to be uniform in the carousel.  

My project 2 page is a to do app which I hope to put the todos in a specific container of my page.
