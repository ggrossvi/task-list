###This is a first draft of my portfolio web site.###

The index page is a carousel of some of the projects I have worked on for #100 days of code.  

Project 1 is getting a response from an api and putting the elements in a table.  
This was a bit challenging since the photos were all different sizes. I didn't 
find a way to successfully manipulate the size of the photos through css. 

Future updates will include adding more options to the navigation including a login page. 
Also adding a description of the projects in the carousel.
Resizing the pictures to be uniform in the carousel.  

My project2 page needs a little more work with the css for the containers because I realized that 
I might not want it to be fluid after I submitted the form because the tasks that I submitted were floating around.
