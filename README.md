#This is a first draft of my portfolio web site.

The index page is a carousel of some of the projects I have worked on for #100 days of code.  

Project 1 recieves a response from an api and puts the response values in a table.  
This was a bit challenging since the photos were all different sizes. I did not 
find a way to successfully manipulate the size of the photos through CSS. I will need to research this further.

Future updates will include adding more options to the navigation bar, including a login page and a logo. 

Also adding a description of the projects in the carousel.
Resizing the pictures to be uniform in the carousel.  

My project2 page needs a little more work with the css for the containers because I realized that 
I might not want it to be fluid after I submitted the form.
